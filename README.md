## CompareOPhone App
**Inventory Control System along with product comparision feature**

## How I got an Idea About this App

Currently in which company I am working,that is a cell phone retails company.EveryTime when customer ask the difference between phones we offer or ask about features of phones. we have to search on google.Which creates a gap between communications. which is Time consuming and sometimes causes losing a sale. To resolve this problem I come up with idea to develop this app. For more 
detail see Features section below.
